# Development Journal

## 2025-05-22

### Session Goals:
- ✅ Set up project structure and documentation
- ✅ Learn basic Git workflow
- ✅ Create comprehensive project foundation
- ⏳ Research Spotify Developer requirements

### Work Completed:
- ✅ Created repository structure with proper documentation
- ✅ Established Git workflow and best practices
- ✅ Defined clear development phases and milestones
- ✅ Set up progress tracking system

### Git Commands Learned:
- `git init` - Initialize repository
- `git status` - Check current state
- `git add` - Stage files for commit
- `git commit -m "message"` - Save changes with description
- `git log --oneline` - View commit history

### Challenges:
- Learning Git syntax and workflow (resolved)
- Balancing documentation thoroughness with development speed

### Key Decisions Made:
- Use React + Node.js tech stack (pending final confirmation)
- Comprehensive documentation from day one
- Phase-based development approach
- Git-integrated progress tracking

### Research Notes:
- Spotify Web API requires OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Rate limits: ~100 requests per minute
- Audio features available: energy, valence, danceability, tempo, etc.
- Need to handle user token refresh

### Next Session Plan:
1. Set up Spotify Developer account
2. Research React vs Vue decision factors
3. Create basic project structure with chosen framework
4. Start OAuth implementation research

### Questions for Next Time:
- What's the best way to securely store Spotify tokens?
- Should we use TypeScript from the start?
- How to structure the project for both web and potential mobile apps?

### Time Spent: ~2 hours
### Energy Level: High - good foundation established
### Confidence Level: Growing - documentation structure feels solid

### GitHub Connection Resolution:
- ✅ Fixed remote repository URL with correct username
- ✅ Successfully pushed all commits to GitHub
- ✅ Established backup and version control workflow
- ✅ Repository accessible at: [your GitHub URL]

### Development Environment Status:
- ✅ React frontend running on localhost:5173
- ✅ Express backend running on localhost:5000
- ✅ Both servers start with `npm run dev`
- ✅ API endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ Git workflow functioning properly

### Ready for Next Phase:
- OAuth implementation with Spotify
- User authentication flow
- Playlist fetching capability
