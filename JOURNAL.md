# Development Journal

## 2025-05-22

### Session Goals:
- ‚úÖ Set up project structure and documentation
- ‚úÖ Learn basic Git workflow
- ‚úÖ Create comprehensive project foundation
- ‚è≥ Research Spotify Developer requirements

### Work Completed:
- ‚úÖ Created repository structure with proper documentation
- ‚úÖ Established Git workflow and best practices
- ‚úÖ Defined clear development phases and milestones
- ‚úÖ Set up progress tracking system

### Git Commands Learned:
- `git init` - Initialize repository
- `git status` - Check current state
- `git add` - Stage files for commit
- `git commit -m "message"` - Save changes with description
- `git log --oneline` - View commit history

### Challenges:
- Learning Git syntax and workflow (resolved)
- Balancing documentation thoroughness with development speed

### Key Decisions Made:
- Use React + Node.js tech stack (pending final confirmation)
- Comprehensive documentation from day one
- Phase-based development approach
- Git-integrated progress tracking

### Research Notes:
- Spotify Web API requires OAuth 2.0 authentication
- Rate limits: ~100 requests per minute
- Audio features available: energy, valence, danceability, tempo, etc.
- Need to handle user token refresh

### Next Session Plan:
1. Set up Spotify Developer account
2. Research React vs Vue decision factors
3. Create basic project structure with chosen framework
4. Start OAuth implementation research

### Questions for Next Time:
- What's the best way to securely store Spotify tokens?
- Should we use TypeScript from the start?
- How to structure the project for both web and potential mobile apps?

### Time Spent: ~2 hours
### Energy Level: High - good foundation established
### Confidence Level: Growing - documentation structure feels solid

### GitHub Connection Resolution:
- ‚úÖ Fixed remote repository URL with correct username
- ‚úÖ Successfully pushed all commits to GitHub
- ‚úÖ Established backup and version control workflow
- ‚úÖ Repository accessible at: [your GitHub URL]

### Development Environment Status:
- ‚úÖ React frontend running on localhost:5173
- ‚úÖ Express backend running on localhost:5000
- ‚úÖ Both servers start with `npm run dev`
- ‚úÖ API endpoints responding correctly
- ‚úÖ Git workflow functioning properly

### Ready for Next Phase:
- OAuth implementation with Spotify
- User authentication flow
- Playlist fetching capability

### OAuth Implementation Complete! üéâ
- ‚úÖ Fixed environment variable loading issue
- ‚úÖ Configured Spotify app with 127.0.0.1 loopback address
- ‚úÖ Created React routing for auth flow
- ‚úÖ Implemented token storage and dashboard redirect
- ‚úÖ Successfully completed end-to-end OAuth authentication

### Technical Learnings:
- Spotify no longer allows localhost, requires 127.0.0.1 for development
- Environment variables need to be in server directory or path configured
- OAuth flow: frontend ‚Üí backend ‚Üí Spotify ‚Üí backend ‚Üí frontend with tokens
- localStorage provides simple session management for development

### Key Debugging Skills Applied:
- Console logging to trace undefined environment variables
- Step-by-step URL testing to isolate redirect URI issues
- Server configuration for loopback address binding

### Next Phase Ready:
- Spotify API access confirmed ‚úÖ
- Ready to fetch user playlists
- Ready to implement playlist analysis

### Playlist Display Implementation Complete! üéµ
- ‚úÖ Created Spotify API service layer with playlist and profile endpoints
- ‚úÖ Built responsive PlaylistList component with grid layout
- ‚úÖ Integrated real user data display with profile photos and stats
- ‚úÖ Added proper error handling and loading states
- ‚úÖ Implemented OAuth token authentication for API calls

### UI/UX Achievements:
- Clean, Spotify-inspired design with green accent colors
- Responsive grid layout for playlist cards
- Profile header with user avatar and follower count
- Playlist covers, descriptions, and metadata display
- Interactive "Analyze" buttons ready for next phase

### Technical Implementation:
- Fetch API calls with Bearer token authentication
- Promise.all for concurrent profile and playlist loading
- CSS-in-JS styling for rapid prototyping
- Error boundaries and token validation

### Ready for Next Phase:
- Playlist analysis algorithm implementation
- Audio feature fetching from Spotify
- Taste profile generation
- Recommendation engine development
