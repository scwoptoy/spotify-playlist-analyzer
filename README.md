## Tech Stack Research Session

### React vs Vue Decision Factors:

#### React Pros:
- Larger ecosystem and job market
- More Spotify API examples and tutorials available
- Better integration with data visualization libraries (D3, Chart.js)
- Stronger TypeScript support
- More Stack Overflow answers for complex issues

#### Vue Pros:
- Gentler learning curve
- Better documentation
- Less boilerplate code
- Simpler state management

#### For This Project:
Given that this is a data-heavy app with visualizations and potential complexity, React seems like the better choice for:
- Audio feature visualization components
- Complex state management for playlist data
- Abundant learning resources for music apps

### Decision: React + Node.js

#### Final Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React with Vite (faster than Create React App)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Charts**: Chart.js (simpler than D3 for our needs)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for user data, playlists, preferences)
- **Cache**: Redis (for Spotify API responses)
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with Spotify

### Next Steps:
1. Set up React project with Vite
2. Install and configure dependencies
3. Create basic project structure
4. Implement OAuth flow
