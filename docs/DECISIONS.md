## ADR-003: Frontend Framework Selection
**Date**: 2025-05-22
**Status**: Accepted

### Context
Need to choose between React and Vue for the frontend framework. Project will involve complex data visualization, state management for playlist analysis, and integration with music APIs.

### Decision
Choose React with Vite build tool.

### Reasoning
- **Ecosystem**: Larger ecosystem with more music/audio related libraries
- **Visualization**: Better integration with Chart.js and D3.js
- **Learning Resources**: More examples of Spotify API integration with React
- **Scalability**: Better for complex state management as app grows
- **Developer Experience**: Vite provides faster development server than CRA

### Alternatives Considered
- **Vue 3**: Simpler learning curve, but smaller ecosystem for music apps
- **Next.js**: Overkill for this project's SSR needs
- **Vanilla JS**: Too much manual work for complex UI

### Consequences
- **Positive**: Access to rich ecosystem, good performance, scalable architecture
- **Negative**: Steeper initial learning curve than Vue
- **Mitigation**: Start with simple components and build complexity gradually
